## What is Fracking?

**Hydraulic fracturing**, or fracking, is a proven technique used in the oil and gas industry for over 60 years. It is designed to enhance the flow and productivity of oil or gas wells. Here’s how it works:

1. **Injection Process**:
    - Water and sand are pumped into an oil or gas formation deep underground.
    - The high-pressure injection creates microfractures in the rock, allowing hydrocarbons (such as oil or natural gas) to flow more easily.
2. **Unlocking Resources**:
    - Fracking releases otherwise irrecoverable resources from specific geological formations.
    - By widening existing cracks or creating new ones, hydrocarbons can flow through these fractures into a well.

## Fracking in Canada
1. **Historical Context**:
    - Fracking was first used in Canada in **1951 near Virden, Manitoba**.
    - In **Alberta**, it was employed to extract hydrocarbons from the **Pembina oil field in 1953**.
2. **Current Usage**:
    - Today, fracking is widely used in several Canadian provinces:
        - **British Columbia**
        - **Alberta**
        - **Saskatchewan**
        - **Manitoba**
3. **Impact and Advances**:
    - Over **170,000 oil and gas wells** have been fractured in Western Canada.
    - Fracking, coupled with advances in **horizontal drilling**, has opened new hydrocarbon production areas.
    - Complex wells extend hundreds or thousands of meters below ground, reaching even further through horizontal or directional drilling.
4. **Key Formations**:
    - Fracking has been crucial in formations such as:
        - **Cardium**
        - **Duvernay**
        - **Viking** (in Alberta)
        - **Bakken** (in Saskatchewan)
        - **Montney** and **Horn River** (in British Columbia)

## Fracking Worldwide
Fracking is used world-wide mainly in Australia, Bulgaria, Russia and Canada. As of 2012, over **2.5 million “frac jobs”** (fracturing operations) had been performed worldwide on oil and gas wells. Fracking is essential for achieving adequate flow rates in shale gas, tight gas, tight oil, and coal seam gas wells globally.
