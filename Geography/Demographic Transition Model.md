- **Definition**: The Demographic Transition Model (DTM) describes the transition from high birth rates (BRs) and high death rates (DRs) to low birth rates and low death rates as a country develops.
- **Purpose**: To illustrate how changes in birth rates and death rates over time affect population growth.

#### Key Terms
- **Demographic**: Relating to the structure of populations.
- **Transition**: A gradual change or shift.

#### Stages of the Demographic Transition Model
1. **Stage 1: High Stationary**
    - **Characteristics**: High birth rates and high death rates.
    - **Population Growth**: Slow and fluctuating.
    - **Societal Context**: Pre-industrial society with limited medical knowledge, high disease prevalence, and subsistence agriculture.
2. **Stage 2: Early Expanding**
    - **Characteristics**: High birth rates and rapidly declining death rates.
    - **Population Growth**: Rapid increase.
    - **Societal Context**: Improvements in healthcare, sanitation, and food supply lead to lower mortality.
3. **Stage 3: Late Expanding**
    - **Characteristics**: Declining birth rates and low death rates.
    - **Population Growth**: Slowing down.
    - **Societal Context**: Continued improvements in healthcare and education, especially for women; urbanization increases.
4. **Stage 4: Low Stationary**
    - **Characteristics**: Low birth rates and low death rates.
    - **Population Growth**: Stable or very slow increase.
    - **Societal Context**: High levels of urbanization, access to contraception, and higher standards of living.
5. **Stage 5: Declining?**
    - **Characteristics**: Very low birth rates, low death rates.
    - **Population Growth**: Decline or negative growth.
    - **Societal Context**: Aging population, higher cost of living, more career-oriented lifestyles.
#### Factors Influencing Each Stage
- **Healthcare**: Availability and quality of medical services.
- **Sanitation**: Clean water and waste management.
- **Nutrition**: Availability of a reliable food supply.
- **Education**: Access to education, particularly for women.
- **Economic Development**: Industrialization, job opportunities, and urbanization.
- **Cultural Factors**: Social norms and values, family planning practices.
#### Implications of the Model
- **Population Policies**: Helps governments in planning and implementing policies related to healthcare, education, and employment.
- **Economic Planning**: Aids in forecasting economic needs and resource allocation.
- **Urban Planning**: Supports infrastructure development in growing urban areas.
- **Environmental Impact**: Highlights the relationship between population growth and environmental stress.

#### Criticisms of the Model
- **Eurocentric**: Initially based on the experience of Western Europe; may not fully apply to all regions.
- **Static Nature**: Does not account for recent changes such as migration, political instability, or rapid technological advancements.
- **Assumptions**: Assumes that all countries will pass through the same stages in a linear manner, which may not hold true universally.
