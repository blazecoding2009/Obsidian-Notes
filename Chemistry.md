Chemistry is the study of anything with mass or volume, its properties or change

#### Pure Substances
- Contain only one type of particle
- Constant Composition
- Melting/boiling points etc are specific

Example:
Aluminum Foil - Aluminum particles
Water - Water Particles
Sugar - Sugar Particles

#### Mixture
- Contains atleast 2 different pure or 2 different types of particles
- Can be separated by physical means
- variable composition
- melting/boiling points are a range of temperatures

Example:
- milk, salad dressing, nails

##### Solution
- homogenous (one phase)
- may be made up of liquids, solids, or gasses
- they mix together so you don't see the individual particles
Example:
- air, salt water, milk, nails

##### Heterogeneous Mixture
- Heterogenous (2 phase)
- particles don't mix well together
Example:
- pizza, salad dressing


# The Periodic Table
- All chemical compounds are composed of elements
- These elements are organized in the Periodic Table

The periodic table arranges elements by increasing atomic number. The tableâ€™s organization into groups and periods helps us predict physical and chemical properties of substances.

Periods - horizontal rows
Families (groups) - vertical columns
