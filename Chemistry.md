Chemistry is the study of anything with mass or volume, its properties or change

#### Pure Substances
- Contain only one type of particle
- Constant Composition
- Melting/boiling points etc are specific

Example:
Aluminum Foil - Aluminum particles
Water - Water Particles
Sugar - Sugar Particles

#### Mixture
- Contains atleast 2 different pure or 2 different types of particles
- Can be separated by physical means
- variable composition
- melting/boiling points are a range of temperatures

Example:
- milk, salad dressing, nails

##### Solution
- homogenous (one phase)
- may be made up of liquids, solids, or gasses
- they mix together so you don't see the individual particles
Example:
- air, salt water, milk, nails

##### Heterogeneous Mixture
- Heterogenous (2 phase)
- particles don't mix well together
Example:
- pizza, salad dressing


# The Periodic Table
- All chemical compounds are composed of elements
- These elements are organized in the Periodic Table

The periodic table arranges elements by increasing atomic number. The table’s organization into groups and periods helps us predict physical and chemical properties of substances.

Periods - horizontal rows
Families (groups) - vertical columns

The periodic table is divided into metals and nonmetals.
##### **Metals**
on the LEFT side of the periodic table
- are shiny, malleable and good conductors
- they react with acids
- they are usually solid at room temperature

##### Nonmetals
are on the RIGHT side of the periodic table
- Are dull, brittle and poor conductors
- they do no react with acids
- they can be solid, liquid or gases at room temperature

**EXCEPTION**: Hydrogen is located on the left side of the table (like metals), BUT it is a gas and a nonmetal.

### Chemical Families
- The groups of the periodic table
- Elements in the same family have the same number of valence electrons
- 4 main ones you should know
![[Pasted image 20250106174347.png]]

#### Alkali Metals
- First column of the periodic table
- Very reactive
- Have one valence electron
- Soluble
- Close to full shell

#### Alkaline Earth Metals
- Second column of the periodic table
- Pretty reactive
- Insoluble
- Have 2 valence electrons
- Close to a full shell (by losing 2 electrons)

#### Halogens
- “7th” column of the periodic table
- Have seven valence electrons
- Toxic and reactive
- Close to a full shell (by GAINing 1 electron)

#### Noble Gases
- The last (8th) column of the periodic table
- Unreactive (inert), stable
- Already have a full shell
