### Energy Flow in Ecosystems

**Key Learning Objectives:**

1. Define and identify terms related to food chains and food webs.
2. Explain how the flow of energy contributes to dynamic equilibrium within ecosystems.

### Source of Energy

- The source of all energy for living organisms is the SUN.
- **Producers (plants)** need energy from the sun for photosynthesis.

---

### Energy in Ecosystems

- **Food Chain:** Demonstrates how energy moves and is used within an ecosystem.
- Energy is lost as it moves up a food chain from producers (plants) to prey and predators.

**Food Chain Dynamics:**

- **Arrows** in a food chain represent the flow of energy.

### Producers & Consumers

- **Producers (Plants):** Organisms that carry out photosynthesis and convert the Sunâ€™s energy into chemical energy.
- **Consumers:** Organisms that eat other organisms to obtain energy. They cannot produce their own food.

Types of Consumers:

1. **Herbivores:** Eat only producers (plants).
2. **Carnivores:** Eat only meat.
3. **Scavengers:** Carnivores that consume dead animals.
4. **Omnivores:** Eat both plants and animals.
5. **Detritivores:** Decomposers that feed on dead organisms and animal wastes (e.g., earthworms, maggots).

---

### Consumer Classification by Trophic Levels:

- **Primary Consumers:** Eat producers (herbivores).
- **Secondary Consumers:** Feed on primary consumers (carnivores or omnivores).
- **Tertiary Consumers:** Feed on secondary consumers (usually carnivores).

---

### Trophic Levels

- **Trophic Level:** The feeding level at which an organism exists in a food chain, indicating how it gains energy.

Example Trophic Levels:

1. **Producer:** Plants
2. **Primary Consumer:** Herbivores
3. **Secondary Consumer:** Carnivores or omnivores
4. **Tertiary Consumer:** Usually carnivores

### The 10% Rule

- Only 10% of the energy in an organism is stored and passed on to the next trophic level; 90% of the energy is used for living.
- Energy distribution:
    - 60% is lost as waste.
    - 30% is used in cellular processes.
    - 10% is used to make body tissues, which is then passed on to the next consumer.

---

### Food Chain Limitations

- Food chains are typically limited to no more than 5 trophic levels due to significant energy loss at each level.
- The more trophic levels there are, the less energy remains from the original amount provided by the producers.

---

### Food Chain vs. Food Web

- **Food Web:** A series of interconnected food chains.
    - Shows all possible pathways for energy flow.
    - Helps predict the impact of adding or removing species from an ecosystem.

**Example Consideration:**

- What impact would a decrease in the rabbit population have?
