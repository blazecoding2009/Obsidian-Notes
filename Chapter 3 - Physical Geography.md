## Plate Movement:
- Lithosphere: Solid outermost portion containing the crust and uppermost mantle
- Asthenosphere: Slushy dense semi0solid rock -  playdough
- Mantle: Layer within the Earth between the crust and the core. Magma comes from within the mantle
- Core: Liquid iron and nickel (outer), solid hot dense ball of iron (inner)

### Theory of Plate Tectonics
- 1912 Alfred Wegener proposed the idea of Continental Drift


## Ring of Fire
 - Long chain of volcanos and mountains that surround the pacific
 
1. What is the Ring of Fire and why is it called Ring of Fire?
		The ring of fire is a long chain of volcanos and mountains that surround the pacific. It contains more than 75% of the world's volcanos
1. What events on the Earth’s surface tend of occur in this regions? Why do they occur here?
    
3. How are many of the volcanoes created? Draw and label a picture of subduction.
    
4. What do trenches and mountain ranges have to do with the Ring of Fire and plate tectonics?
    
5. Find Hawaii on the map in Figure 2. Is it a part of the Ring of Fire? How do you think Hawaii’s volcanos were formed?
    
6. How are earthquakes and volcanoes related?
    
7. What do you think communities do to protect themselves against volcanic activity?
