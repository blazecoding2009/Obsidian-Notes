Definition: The <u>study</u> and <u>interpretation</u> of the past

### Why study History
- Helps us understand the links between the past and the present
	- Example: court system, judicial system is British, not French
- Helps us learn to research and think critically
- Allows us to express our ideas both verbally and through writing

## Different kinds of history

- Military - military tactics?
- Religious - how religions have changed throughout time
- Environmental - more like geo prolly
- Medical - how medicine has changed and practices
- Cultural - culture ex. american culture
- Social History - idk tbh
- Economic - economics and inflation!

## The <u>six</u> concepts of historical thinking
1. Historical Evidence
	-  Knowing the truth is very important
	-  So that we don't repeat our previous mistakes
	-  The truth hurts sometimes
	-  Truth is hard to come by
		How to know what's truth

> [!important]
> First-hand account
> Such as diaries, videos, letters, interviews, photographs, art, maps, newspapers, etc
>    
> Second-hand accounts
> Such as history textbooks, biographies, movies of the events, commentaries
> 
>  - do have biases in them
>  - sometimes not true
>  - second hand accounts are sometimes profit driven  

 > [!note]

>-  Can cause selection or emphasis on some facts while ignoring others
>-  Bias can be exclusionary ex. leaving out a few points to make ppl think its good/bad

2. Historical Significance
		Everything cannot be recorded. You can't record someone's entire life.
		5 BIG REASONS history gets recorded
			 - People at the time thought it was important such as buffalos
			 - It affected lots of people such as a war
			 - It affected people for a long time such as a government
			 - It still affects attitudes or beliefs today such as religion
			 - It led to other important events 
3. Historical Perspective
		- It's important to identify what perspectives people had throughout history.
		- Everyone has different perspectives because of their upbringing, status, race, and culture.
		- What was the society and culture of the time?
		    - We need to understand their culture, what values people held, and their beliefs.
		    - See history through their eyes.
		        - **Note:** This doesn't mean you need to agree with their perspective.
4. Cause and Consequences
		- **The domino effect:** What is the relationship between the event and the result?
		- **Interpret and analyse** the results of the event.
		    - There are many causes and consequences to events.
		    - They vary in significance.
		- **Two factors causing events:**
		    1. People and their decisions.
		    2. Conditions (e.g., social, political, economic, cultural).
5. Continuity and Change
		- **Understanding certain things** (e.g., attitudes, processes, actions, and beliefs) change over time, and certain things stay the same.
		- **How and why do things change** over time?
		- **How and why do beliefs evolve** or stay the same?
		- Are the changes positive, negative, or neutral?
		- What will people say about us?
6. Ethical Dimensions
		- **Moral principles** that govern a person's behavior or conducting of an activity.
		- **Questioning the ethics** of the people:
		    - Was it fair?
		    - Was it honest?
		- People shouldnâ€™t be excused from their actions, but their actions should be examined.

## Imperialism
The extension of one nation's authority or control over other lands by economic, political or military means. basically the land becomes a colony

One of the biggest example of this was the British empire because they colonized almost 25% of the world. 

Advantages:
- economic
- colonies provide raw material, motherland takes these raw materials for their industries and exports manufactured goods

Many European countries had colonies:
France - North Africa, Indochina
Portugal - East Indies
Belgium - Africa
Germany - started late but had a few colonies in Africa. They wanted more and showed some aggression in Africa

## Nationalism
A strong sense of pride in one's country, belief that their country is destined for greatness and superior to others
