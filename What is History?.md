### Why study History
- Helps us understand the links between the past and the present
	- Example: court system, judicial system is British, not French
- Helps us learn to research and think critically
- Allows us to express our ideas both verbally and through writing

- Religious - how religions have changed throughout time
- Environmental - more like geo prolly
- Medical - how medicine has changed and practices

## The <u>six</u> concepts of historical thinking
1. Historical Evidence

	-  The truth hurts sometimes
	-  Truth is hard to come by
		How to know what's truth
